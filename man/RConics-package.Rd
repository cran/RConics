\title{RConics: Computations on conics}
\description{
A package to solve some conic related problems 
(intersection of conics with lines and conics, arc length of an ellipse, 
polar lines, etc.).
}
\details{
Some of the functions are based on the \emph{projective} geometry. 
In projective geometry parallel lines meet at an infinite point and 
all infinite points are incident to a line at infinity. 
Points and lines of a projective plane are represented by \emph{homogeneous}
 coordinates, that means by 3D vectors: \eqn{(x, y, z)} for the points and 
 \eqn{(a, b, c)} such that \eqn{ax + by + c = 0} for the lines. 
 The Euclidian points correspond to \eqn{(x, y, 1)}, 
 the infinite points to \eqn{(x, y, 0)}, the Euclidean lines to 
 \eqn{(a, b, c)} with \eqn{a \neq 0} or \eqn{b \neq 0}, the line at 
 infinity to \eqn{(0, 0, 1)}.
 
 \strong{Advice}: to plot conics use the package \code{conics} 
 from Bernard Desgraupes.
